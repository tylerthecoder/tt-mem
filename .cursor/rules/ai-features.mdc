# AI-Assisted Features

This project incorporates AI to assist with deck and card creation/management.

## AI Deck Generation

- **Entry Point (UI)**: The page at `[app/deck/ai-generate/page.tsx](mdc:app/deck/ai-generate/page.tsx)` allows users to input a topic and generate a new deck with AI-suggested cards.
- **Server Action**: The `createDeckWithAICardsAction` (expected in `app/actions/aiDecks.ts` or similar) handles the backend logic.
    - It takes a topic from the user.
    - Interacts with an AI service to generate card content (front/back text).
    - Creates a new deck and populates it with the generated cards.
- **Relevant Types**:
    - `QuestionAnswerPair` from `[app/types.ts](mdc:app/types.ts)` might be used for the AI-generated card content.

## AI Card Editing (within a Deck)

- **Context**: On the deck overview page (`[app/deck/[deckId]/overview/page.tsx](mdc:app/deck/[deckId]/overview/page.tsx)`), users can initiate AI-assisted editing for the cards within that deck.
- **Components**:
    - `AIEditPromptModal`: A modal component that likely takes user input or a prompt to guide the AI in suggesting card edits.
    - `AIEditReviewList`: A component to display the AI's suggestions for card modifications (creations, updates, deletions) and allow the user to accept or reject them.
- **Server Actions**: (Specific actions for applying these AI edits are not detailed but would reside in server actions, possibly in `[app/actions/cards.ts](mdc:app/actions/cards.ts)` or a dedicated AI actions file.)
- **Suggestion Types** (from `[app/types.ts](mdc:app/types.ts)`): These types define the structure of AI suggestions for modifying cards.
    - `AICreateCardSuggestion`: Suggests creating a new card.
        ```typescript
        export interface AICreateCardSuggestion {
            type: 'create';
            front_text: string;
            back_text: string;
            extra_context?: string;
        }
        ```
    - `AIUpdateCardSuggestion`: Suggests updating an existing card.
        ```typescript
        export interface AIUpdateCardSuggestion {
            type: 'update';
            cardId: string;
            front_text?: string;
            back_text?: string;
            extra_context?: string;
        }
        ```
    - `AIDeleteCardSuggestion`: Suggests deleting an existing card.
        ```typescript
        export interface AIDeleteCardSuggestion {
            type: 'delete';
            cardId: string;
        }
        ```
    - `AICardEditSuggestion`: A union type encompassing the above suggestions.
