# Styling (Tailwind CSS v4)

Styling is handled using [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha).

- **Setup:** Tailwind is imported directly into `[app/globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css)` using `@import "tailwindcss";`.
- **Theme Customization:** Custom theme values (like primary/secondary colors) are defined using the `@theme` directive within `[app/globals.css](mdc:app/globals.css)`.
- **Usage:** Standard Tailwind utility classes are used throughout the components (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-gray-900`, `p-4`, `rounded`).
- **Consistency:** The project aims for a consistent look, avoiding explicit light/dark mode variations (`dark:` prefixes have been removed).
